Originally programs compiled using Borland C++. Examples compiled using
g++ are given at the end of every Module. For example if you want to
compile C++ codes using VC++/VC++ .Net, change the header file accordingly.
Just need some modification for the header files...:

-------------------------------------------------
#include <iostream.h>
//for system()
#include <stdlib.h>

...
{
C++ codes...
}
-------------------------------------------------
should be changed to:
-------------------------------------------------
#include <iostream>
//use C++ wrapper to call C functions from C++ programs...
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std;

...
{
C++ codes...
}
-------------------------------------------------
In VC++/VC++ .Net the iostream.h (header with .h) is not valid anymore.
It should be C++ header, <iostream> so that it comply to the standard.
In older Borland C++ compiler this still works, but not proper any more...
and for standard C/C++ the portability should be no problem or better
you read Module23 at http://www.tenouk.com/Module23.html to get
the big picture...For C codes, they still C codes :o)
=========================================================================
============================HERE, ALL C++ codes==========================


//function object example
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

//simple function object that prints the passed argument
class PrintSomething
{
public:
void operator() (int elem) const
{
cout<<elem<<' ';
}
};

int main()
{
vector<int> vec;
//insert elements from 1 to 10
for(int i=1; i<=10; ++i)
vec.push_back(i);

//print all elements
for_each (vec.begin(), vec.end(), //range
PrintSomething()); //operation
cout<<endl;
}
