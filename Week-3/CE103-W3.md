## Introduction to Source Code Management Systems

### Git, Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, Maven, SVN, TFS

Source code management (SCM) is used to track modifications to a source code repository. SCM tracks a running history of changes to a code base and helps resolve conflicts when merging updates from multiple contributors. SCM is also synonymous with Version control. 
As software projects grow in lines of code and contributor head count, the costs of communication overhead and management complexity also grow. SCM is a critical tool to alleviate the organizational strain of growing development costs.

## Features of Source Code Management Systems

- Authenticated access for commits

- Revision history on files

- Atomic commits of multiple files

- Versioning/Tagging

## Why Do We Need Source Code Management Systems?

We can save the file with a different name if it’s our school project or one-time papers but for a well-equipped software development? Not a chance.

Big projects need a version control system to track the changes and avoid misunderstanding. A good SCM does the following:

**Backup and Restore** – Files can be saved at any moment and can be restored from the last saved.

**Synchronization** – Programmers can get the latest code and fetch the up-to-date codes from the repository.

**Short-Term Undo** – Working with a file and messed it up. We can do a short-term undo to the last known version.

**Long-Term Undo** – It helps when we have to make a release version rollback. Something like going to the last version which was created a year

**Track Change**s – We can track the changes as when anyone is making any change, he can leave a commit message as for why the change was done.

**Ownership**– With every commit made to the master branch, it will ask the owner permission to merge it.

**Branching and Merging** – You can create a branch of your source code and create the changes. Once the changes are approved, you can merge it with the master branch.

## Types of Version Control Systems

### Centralized Version Control (TFS, Subversion)

The main concept of Centralized Version Control is that it works in a client and server relationship. The repository is located in one place and allows access to multiple clients.

<img src="file:///E:/UgurCoruh/RTEU/Lectures/2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I/Lectures/Github/Week-3/assets/2021-10-19-20-40-58-image.png" title="" alt="" data-align="center">

<img src="file:///E:/UgurCoruh/RTEU/Lectures/2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I/Lectures/Github/Week-3/assets/2021-10-19-20-41-08-image.png" title="" alt="" data-align="center">

It’s very similar to FTP where you have FTP clients which connect to FTP server. Here all the user changes and commits have to pass through the central server. For Ex: Subversion.

**The benefits of centralized version control are:**

- It’s easy to understand.

- There are more GUI and IDE clients.

- You have more control over the users and access.

**We do have drawbacks also:**

- It is dependent on the access to the server. 

- It can be slower because every command from the client has to pass the server.

- Branching and merging strategies are difficult to use.

## Distributed Version Control (Git and Mercurial)

These systems are newer to use. In Distributed Version Control, each user has their own copy of the entire repository as well as the files and history. For Ex: Git and Mercurial

<img src="file:///E:/UgurCoruh/RTEU/Lectures/2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I/Lectures/Github/Week-3/assets/2021-10-19-20-45-02-image.png" title="" alt="" data-align="center">

<img src="file:///E:/UgurCoruh/RTEU/Lectures/2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I/Lectures/Github/Week-3/assets/2021-10-19-20-45-13-image.png" title="" alt="" data-align="center">

The benefits of distributed version control are:

- More powerful and easy change tracking.

- No need of a centralized server. Most of the functionalities work in offline mode also apart from sharing the repositories.

- Branching and Merging strategies are more easy and reliable.

- It’s faster than the other one.

## A Basic Overview of How Git Works

- Create a “repository” (project) with a git hosting tool (like Bitbucket)

- Copy (or clone) the repository to your local machine

- Add a file to your local repo and “commit” (save) the changes

- “Push” your changes to your master branch

- Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit

- “Pull” the changes to your local machine

- Create a “branch” (version), make a change, commit the change

- Open a “pull request”.

- “Merge” your branch to the master branch

## Some of The Basic Operations in GIT are

- Initialize

- Add

- Commit

- Pull

- Push

### Installation of GIT Extension (Windows)

You can install Git GUI from https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis
I prefer to use git extension https://gitextensions.github.io/ and https://tortoisegit.org/

These extensions provide GUI for git operations to make process easier.

### Configuration of GIT Extension (Windows)

![](E:\UgurCoruh\RTEU\Lectures\2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I\Lectures\Github\Week-3\assets\2021-10-19-23-08-51-image.png)

If you install git everything should be green.

### Using the GIT Extension

right click in the git folder and use Git Extension menu for operations.

for sample commit click "Commit"

![](E:\UgurCoruh\RTEU\Lectures\2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I\Lectures\Github\Week-3\assets\2021-10-19-23-10-32-image.png)

from opening window first stage related files and then write a good commit message

finally click commit to local. You can also commit&push it to remote repository.

## Configuration of GIT

It is important to configure your Git because any commits that you
make are associated with your configuration details.

configuring Git with your username and email. In order to do that, type the following commands in your Git Bash:

```batch
git config - - global user.name "<your name>"

git config - - global user.email "<your email>"
```

![](E:\UgurCoruh\RTEU\Lectures\2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I\Lectures\Github\Week-3\assets\2021-10-20-00-15-38-image.png)

git configuration files are located on the user folder

![](E:\UgurCoruh\RTEU\Lectures\2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I\Lectures\Github\Week-3\assets\2021-10-20-00-16-06-image.png)

If you want to view all your configuration details, use the command below

```batch
git config --list
```

![](E:\UgurCoruh\RTEU\Lectures\2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I\Lectures\Github\Week-3\assets\2021-10-20-00-17-00-image.png)

### Using .gitignore files with git-extension

with gitignore file

![](E:\UgurCoruh\RTEU\Lectures\2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I\Lectures\Github\Week-3\assets\2021-10-20-00-51-16-image.png)

without gitignore file (just move to another location)

![](E:\UgurCoruh\RTEU\Lectures\2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I\Lectures\Github\Week-3\assets\2021-10-20-00-51-39-image.png)

# Github Create Repo

<img src="file:///E:/UgurCoruh/RTEU/Lectures/2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I/Lectures/Github/Week-3/assets/2021-10-20-00-52-14-image.png" title="" alt="" data-align="center">

# Initilization of Repo

## git init

- In order to do that, we use the command **git init**.

- **git init** creates an empty Git repository or re-initializes an existing one. It basically creates a **.git** directory with sub directories and template files. Running a **git init** in an existing repository will not overwrite things that are already there. It rather picks up the newly added templates.

```batch
git init
```

![](E:\UgurCoruh\RTEU\Lectures\2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I\Lectures\Github\Week-3\assets\2021-10-20-00-56-52-image.png)

# Checking Repository Status

### git status

The git status command lists all the modified files which are ready to be added to the local repository.

```batch
git status
```

![](E:\UgurCoruh\RTEU\Lectures\2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I\Lectures\Github\Week-3\assets\2021-10-20-00-57-52-image.png)

# Adding Files to Index

### git add

This command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree
and then prepares the content in the staging area for the next commit.

```batch
git add <directory>
git add <file>
git add *
```

Created two more files edureka3.txt and edureka4.txt. Let us add the files using the command git add -A. This command will add all the files to the index which are in the directory but not updated in the index yet.

![](E:\UgurCoruh\RTEU\Lectures\2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I\Lectures\Github\Week-3\assets\2021-10-20-00-59-59-image.png)

# Commit Changes

### git commit

•It refers to recording snapshots of the repository at a given time. Committed
snapshots will never change unless done explicitly. Let me explain how commit
works with the diagram below

![](E:\UgurCoruh\RTEU\Lectures\2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I\Lectures\Github\Week-3\assets\2021-10-20-01-00-44-image.png)

Here, C1 is the initial commit, i.e. the snapshot of the first change from which
another snapshot is created with changes named C2. Note that the master points
to the latest commit. Now, when I commit again, another snapshot C3 is created and now the master points to C3 instead of C2.

Commands:

```batch
git commit -m "<message>"
```

![](E:\UgurCoruh\RTEU\Lectures\2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I\Lectures\Github\Week-3\assets\2021-10-20-01-01-42-image.png)

Now, if you want to commit a snapshot of all the changes in the working directory at
once, you can use the command below

```batch
git commit -a
```

![](E:\UgurCoruh\RTEU\Lectures\2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I\Lectures\Github\Week-3\assets\2021-10-20-01-02-26-image.png)

I have created two more text files in my working directory viz. edureka5.txt and edureka6.txt but they are not added to the index yet.

I am adding edureka5.txt using the command

```batch
git add edureka5.txt
```

![](E:\UgurCoruh\RTEU\Lectures\2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I\Lectures\Github\Week-3\assets\2021-10-20-01-03-52-image.png)

 I have added edureka5.txt to the index explicitly but not edureka6.txt and made changes in the previous files. I want to commit all changes in the directory at once.

> This command will commit a snapshot of all changes in the working directory but only includes modifications to tracked files i.e. the files that have been added with git add at some point in their history. Hence, edureka6.txt was not committed because it was not added to the index yet. But changes in all previous files present in the repository were committed, i.e. edureka1.txt, edureka2.txt, edureka3.txt, edureka4.txt and edureka5.txt.   Now I have made my desired commits in my local repository

# Update local repo before sending

### git pull

Note that before you affect changes to the central repository you should always pull
changes from the central repository to your local repository to get updated with the work of all the collaborators that have been contributing in the central repository. For that we will use the pull command.

But first, you need to set your central repository as origin using the command

```batch
git remote add origin <link of your central repository>
```

![](E:\UgurCoruh\RTEU\Lectures\2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I\Lectures\Github\Week-3\assets\2021-10-20-01-06-43-image.png)

> Now that my origin is set

let us extract files from the origin using pull. For that use the command

```batch
git pull origin master
```

![](E:\UgurCoruh\RTEU\Lectures\2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I\Lectures\Github\Week-3\assets\2021-10-20-01-07-44-image.png)

This command will copy all the files from the master branch of remote repository to your local repository.

> Since my local repository was already updated with files from master branch, hence the message is Already up-to-date. Refer to the screen shot above

One can also try pulling files from a different branch using the following command:

```batch
git pull origin <branch-name>
```

> Your local Git repository is now updated with all the recent changes. It is time you make changes in the central repository by using the push command.

# Send Changes to Remote Repo

### git push

- This command transfers commits from your local repository to your remote repository. It is the opposite of pull operation.

- Pulling imports commits to local repositories whereas pushing exports commits to the remote repositories

- The use of git push is to publish your local changes to a central repository. After you’ve accumulated several local commits and are ready to share them with the rest of the team, you can then push them to the central repository by using the following command

```batch
git push <remote> 
```

> This remote refers to the remote repository which had been set before using the pull command.

- This pushes the changes from the local repository to the remote repository along
  with all the necessary commits and internal objects. This creates a local branch in the destination repository

The below files are the files which we have already committed previously in the commit section and they are all “push-ready“.

I will use the command `git push origin master` to reflect these files in the master branch of my central repository.

![](E:\UgurCoruh\RTEU\Lectures\2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I\Lectures\Github\Week-3\assets\2021-10-20-01-12-19-image.png)

![](E:\UgurCoruh\RTEU\Lectures\2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I\Lectures\Github\Week-3\assets\2021-10-20-01-12-33-image.png)

![](E:\UgurCoruh\RTEU\Lectures\2021-2022%20Güz%20CE103%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Programming%20I\Lectures\Github\Week-3\assets\2021-10-20-01-12-47-image.png)

> To prevent overwriting, Git does not allow push when it results in a non-fast forward merge in the destination repository.
> 
> A non-fast forward merge means an upstream merge i.e. merging with ancestor or parent branches from a child branch
> 
> To enable such merge, use the command below
> 
> ```batch
> git push <remote> -force
> ```

The above command forces the push operation even if it results in a non-fast
forward merge
