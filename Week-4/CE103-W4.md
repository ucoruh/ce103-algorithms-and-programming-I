# CE103 Week-4

## Introduction to Code Reusability and Automated Testing

During this course we will use entry level of shared library development and their tests and test automations. Also we will see TDD(Test Driven Development) approach.

During this course we will use **Windows OS, Eclipse and Visual Studio Commuity Edition** environments for examples.

Each example will include two function 

"Hello <name>" printing function with name sayHelloTo(name) and

sum of two variable function for basic, sum = sum(a,b). 

This sum function will add a to b and return result to sum variable. 

We will locate them in library and use them from a console application, also we will create unit tests for testing their functionalities and return variables
