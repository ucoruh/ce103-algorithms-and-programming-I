## What is Port?

In [computer networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_networking), a port is a communication endpoint. At the software level, within an [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system), a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific [process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)) or a type of [network service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_service). A port is identified for each [transport protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_protocol) and address combination by a 16-bit [unsigned number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsigned_number), known as the port number.
The most common transport protocols that use port numbers are the [Transmission
Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) (TCP) and the [User Datagram Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) (UDP).

## Introduction to the command line interface

---

## What is the command line?

The window, which is usually called the **command line** or **command-line interface**, is a text-based application for viewing, handling, and manipulating files on your computer. It's much like Windows Explorer or Finder on the Mac, but without the graphical interface. Other names for the command line are: 

`cmd, CLI, prompt, console or terminal `

While there are many commands you can use with CLI, they all fall into <u>two categories</u>:

- The commands that handle the processes

- The commands that handle the files
